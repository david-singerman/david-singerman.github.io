    <p>I'm an assistant professor of history and American studies at the University of Virginia. <a href="http://history.virginia.edu/people/profile/ds2ax">(Click here for my History Department webpage.)</a> I am also the Director of Undergraduate Program for American Studies.</p>

    <p>I earned my PhD in 2014 from MIT's program in <a href="http://web.mit.edu/hasts/">History, Anthropology, and Science, Technology, and Society</a> (HASTS), supervised by <a href="http://web.mit.edu/dikaiser/www/">Professor David Kaiser</a>.
