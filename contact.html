    <h2>How to contact me</h2>
        <p> You can email me about research, teaching, etc. at <a class="button" href="mailto:ds2ax@virginia.edu"> ds2ax@virginia.edu</a>. 
        <p> Please note that all emails sent to this address are subject to Virginia's <a href="https://universitycounsel.virginia.edu/foia">Freedom of Information Act.</a> </p>
    </p>
    <p> 
        You can occasionally find me on what I'll always call Twitter üê• at <a href="https://x.com/singsingsolo"> @singsingsolo.</a>
    </p>

    <p>You can schedule a meeting with me by using <a href="https://scheduler.zoom.us/david-singerman">this scheduling tool.</a></p>

<h2>Requesting a letter of recommendation</h2>

<p>To make things easier for you and for me, I've created a Google form where you can submit letter of recommendation requests. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdW0BNan-6u0Lfk_6bVHVZGu2VZFUPbB_1ekqt94paXcIyJDg/viewform?usp=sf_link">Click here for the form,</a> but not until after you read the rest of this page.</p>

<p>If you would like me to write a letter of recommendation, I need a few documents from you.</p>

<p>The little bit of time it will take you to prepare them will more than pay off in the strength of the letter I can write. And you can reuse most of this material for future letters from me or others.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Your resume</li>
    <li>Your transcript</li>
    <li>Whatever application essays/statements/cover letter you have</li>
   <li>And then a page or two of (informal) writing about yourself, covering as much of the following as relevant:
        <ul>
        <li>Where you're from (in whatever sense that question is most meaningful to you)</li>
       <li>Noteworthy experiences/accomplishments before UVA, and those during UVA but outside coursework</li>
       <li>Your path at UVA‚Äîhow did your interests and goals changed while you were here, or have your original commitments been reinforced?</li>
        <li>What strengths of yours you'd especially like me to mention</li>
        <li>Anything on your transcript or resume that it would be helpful for me to address (like a relatively low grade, a gap, etc.)</li>
        <li>Anything else you'd like me to address that I don't know</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
The Google form is <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdW0BNan-6u0Lfk_6bVHVZGu2VZFUPbB_1ekqt94paXcIyJDg/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>.

With thanks to Prof. Ira Bashkow for this idea.
