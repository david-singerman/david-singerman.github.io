<p>In 2025 I received the <a href="https://provost.virginia.edu/teaching-awards">Alumni Board of Trustees Teaching Award</a>, given to one assistant professor at UVA each year. <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/uva-honors-its-top-teachers">Click here for the UVA Today news story.</a></p>

<p>I am currently co-developing a new lecture course called "The Rise of Bread: A Deep History" with Prof. Ali Guler in the Department of Biology, for which we received a <a href="https://learningdesign.as.virginia.edu/science-society-ss-course-co-design-grant">Science & Society course co-design grant></a> from the College of Arts and Sciences at UVA.</p>
